**PCA.R**
<br />
Generate PCA plots using transcript experssion matrix. 

<br />

**TotalRNAseq_DE_analysis.R**
<br />
Perform differential expression of two groups of totalRNA-seq samples by calling DESeq and select differentia expression gene candidates using pre-defined signoldificance threshold.

<br />

**TotalRNAseq_DE_fixed_cutoff.R**
<br />
Perform differential expression of two groups of totalRNA-seq samples by calling DESeq and select differentia expression gene candidates using user-defined signoldificance threshold. 

<br />

**Targeted_RNAseq_Human_DE_analysis.R**
<br />
Perform differential expression of two groups of targeted RNA-seq samples by mapping Ensembl IDs to gene names and calling DESeq and select differentia expression gene candidates using pre-defined signoldificance. 

<br />

**TCGA_RNAseq_Human_DE_fixed_cutoff.R** 
<br />
Perform differential expression of two groups of RNA-seq samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas by mapping Ensembl IDs to gene names and calling DESeq and select differentia expression gene candidates using user-defined signoldificance. 

<br />

**Pathway_analysis_plot.R**
<br />
